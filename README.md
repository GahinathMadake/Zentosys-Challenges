## E-commerce App Schema
This project focuses on modeling a robust schema for a scalable eCommerce platform using MongoDB and Express.js, along with a basic API to retrieve products by vendor.

ðŸ“Œ Challenge Task
Design and implement schema with the following collections:

User (name, email, password hash, role, cart)

Product (name, price, stock, category, vendorId)

Order (userId, productIds, status, timestamps)

Cart (userId, products[] with quantity, total)

Bonus: Create an API to fetch all products of a specific vendor.

ðŸ§¾ Description
